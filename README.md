# Bash Interpreter

bash_grammar.txt : has grammar extracted from yacc file used by Bash itself, just for reference

Includes 4 interpreters for now :
- for parsing arguments
- for brace expansions
- for an extended bash arithmetic expression parsing
- and finally, the bash language interpreter itself (not-finished)
